<p>After months of planning and preparation, it was finally time for me and Alex to catch our flight to the Sunshine Coast. Our initial plan was to thru-hike the entire 180km trail in 7 days, which at around 26km/day sounded reasonable. Unforunately, the <a href="http://globalnews.ca/news/3230587/b-c-snowfall-records-smashed-this-weekend-as-snow-blankets-province/">record snowfall</a> experienced by the West Coast this winter meant that a good portion of the trail was still covered in snow. A lot of snow, as we would soon find out.</p>

<p>I woke up on the morning of the trip feeling nervous. The weatherman warned of a "winter storm" (it was April, for heaven's sake!) that was to hit the Sunshine Coast with "potentially damaging winds" at exactly the time our flight was to land, and I naturally worried that our flight would get cancelled. After a day of nervously checking the flight status at work, Alex and I got a ride from my wonderful manager (thanks Edmund!) to the <a href="http://www.yvr.ca/en/passengers/flights/airport-south">South Terminal</a> of YVR Airport.</p>

<p>80km winds and 180km hikes generally don't mix. Neither do propellor planes or sketchy "rock drops" from a boat.</p>
<p>And yet here we were, at <a href="http://www.yvr.ca/en/passengers/flights/airport-south">South Terminal</a> of YVR Airport.</p>
