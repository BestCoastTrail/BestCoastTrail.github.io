It is still raining hard when I wake up. With that in mind, the first thing I do is change out of my warm and dry merino wool baselayer into still-damp socks and underwear when it's 5 degrees outside. Solid start to the morning. I can already tell it's going to be a long and difficult day. I see that Alex's shoes are in a newly formed puddle of mud.

Hot tea makes life immeasurably better. 

After a warm cup of tea and a couple scoops of peanut butter and some m&amp;m's, I venture outside our hut, umbrella in hand (nothing is truly waterproof, expect umbrellas), and I'm greeted by a spectacular vista of fresh snow and fog skimming the tops of the trees in the distance.

We pack up our bags and start hiking. Since we weren't able to make it to Anthony Island hut on the east end of Inland Lake, which is where the trail continues, we have walk the perimeter of the lake to get to Anthony Island, effectively adding another 4 kms to our day. We don't have any definitely plans on which hut we are aiming for today - we are planning to see how we're feeling when we get to Confederation Lake, which is about 13 kms away, and see if there's enough time remaining to make it to Fiddlehead Landing.

The views along the lake are simply stunning. There is a hint of sun, and I'm hopeful that the weather will improve, because our shoes are already starting to get wet. I'm wearing a relatively new pair of Gore-Tex Salomon trail runners, and it predicably fails to keep the rain out. <a href="http://andrewskurka.com/2016/waterproof-gore-tex-shoes-second-chance-complete-failure/">Gore-Tex doesn't work!</a> My advice? Buy light and breathable trail runners and just suck it up. It'll dry faster. 

We eventually get to Anthony Hut, but instead of turning left and continuing on with the trail, we misread the sign as indicating a different trail and continue going straight. It would be another half-hour before we realize our mistake and backtrack. Our supposedly short hike to Confederation Lake is getting longer and longer.

Shortly after we backtrack and get back on the correct trail, we run into heavy trail debris, making it much more difficult to spot the trailmarkers and slowing us down considerably. We need to (ungracefully) dodge, jump, duck, and weave our way through the dense forest. For some parts we're just bushwhacking.

Then, to add to the difficulty, the trail becomes steep, with dozens of fallen trees in our path thrown in for good measure. The hiking gods are not in a good mood today.
