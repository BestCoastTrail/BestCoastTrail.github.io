We wake up early, knowing we have a long day ahead. After taking a wonderful hot shower, thinking "won't have one of these for a while", Alex and I pack up and head to the campground to stash some of our food and our snowshoes, planning to pick them up as we pass through Powell River at roughly the 1/3 mark of the Sunshine Coast Trail. Before getting on with the story, let me outline the plan. 
<h2 style="margin:0;">The plan</h2>
<ul style="margin:0;">
  <li><p style="margin:0;">Day 1: hike to Rieveley's Pond.</p></li>
  <li><p style="margin:0;">Day 2: pick up snowshoes and rest of food from campground, and then hike to Inland Lake. </p></li>
  <li><p style="margin:0;">Day 3: hike to Fiddlehead Landing.</p></li>
  <li><p style="margin:0;">Day 4: hike to Tinhat Mountain.</p></li>
  <li><p style="margin:0;">Day 5: hike to Elk Lake</p></li>
  <li><p style="margin:0;">Day 6: hike to Walk Hill</p></li>
  <li><p style="margin:0;">Day 7: hike to Mount Troubridge</p></li>
  <li><p style="margin:0;">Day 8: complete the hike</p></li>
</ul>

We know that the first 80km or so are free of snow, due to the relatively low elevation, and so we plan to cover a lot of ground in the first two days: 33km on the first day, to Rieveley's Pond, and 32km on the second, to Inland Lake. 

On the way to the campground, we pick up coffee and pizza bread, loading up on as many calories as we can. It is still windy from last night's storm, but nowhere near as intense. After stashing our gear with a very nice lady at the campground, I call a cab so that we can get to Lund, which is a half-hour car ride north of Powel River. The operator on the phone informs me that <em>both</em> taxis are busy, but that she would send one soon as possible. While we wait for the cab, a lady approaches us. Her name is Jill, and from her outfit it's easy to tell she's also a hiker. She asks us if we're doing the Sunshine Coast Trail (our large backpacks probably gave us away). We say yes and tell her about our plan. And to our surprise, Jill offers us a ride from the trailhead back to the campground to grab our stuff the next day to save us some time and energy, and gives me her cell number. Alex and I are flabbergasted - everyone we've encounted at Powell River have been bewilderingly kind.

During the cab ride, our driver tells us that some other hikers he's picked up recently told him that some parts of the trail were still covered in over 2 meters of snow. Good thing we packed our snowshoes!

It is recommended to hike the Sunshine Coast Trail from north to south. The trailhead is called Sarah Point, and it is generally accessed by taking a water taxi from Lund. We had booked the water taxi with two other hikers, but unfortunately, due to the previous night's storm, their ferry to the Sunshine Coast got cancelled, so we had to split the cost of the ride in half, costing us over $100 each.

There is no dock at Sarah Point, so to get off the boat and onto land, we are told by the folks at the front desk that we'd need to do a "rock drop". It sounded easy enough at the time...

During the ride, I told our boat driver (I didn't manage to get his name) that we were really glad that we could get to Sarah Point today, despite the recent storm and still-high winds. He simply replied, "I haven't gotten you there yet." I shut up after that. He was clearly hardcore, wearing a "Git-R-Done" hat. If anybody could get us to Sarah Point today, waves and all, it would be him.

He told us to not rush the drop, that he would manuver the boat to give us the best chance of making it on the rocks. Normally, with low winds and calm waters, he turns the boat parallel to the rock face, so that we could simply hop off the side of the boat with our backpacks. Today was <em>not</em> one of those days. The gap is too large for us to safely jump, and the boat is sloshing around like mad. To make matters worse, the waves kept pushing the boat towards the rocks, and boats don't have sideway propulsion systems. 

After struggling for a while, he eventually tells us to walk to the bow of the boat without our backpacks. <em>This is what being told to walk the plank must feel like</em>, I think to myself. Meanwhile, the boat is really rocking. Taking a deep breath, Alex and I each take a side of the boat and carefully walk to the bow. Then, he directs the boat towards the rock face. Alex and I ready ourselves. We jump!

  <figcaption>This was after I managed to pull my bag off the bow of the boat. Alex's bag is still visible on the bow.</figcaption>
</figure>
We're on land now! However, our ordeal isn't over yet - we still need to get our backpacks off the bow. I watch the boat rock from side to side, our unsecured backpacks rocking with it. I'm terrified that our backpacks would slip silently into the sea; beyond effectively ending our trip, my backpack alone contains over $3000 worth of equipment, and I definitely didn't purchase the "bag dropped in ocean" insurance package.
