We wake up early, knowing we have a long day ahead. After taking a wonderful hot shower, thinking "won't have one of these for a while", Alex and I pack up and head to the campground to stash some of our food and our snowshoes, planning to pick them up as we pass through Powell River at roughly the 1/3 mark of the Sunshine Coast Trail. Before getting on with the story, let me outline the plan. 
<h2 style="margin:0;">The plan</h2>
<ul style="margin:0;">
  <li><p style="margin:0;">Day 1: hike to Rieveley's Pond.</p></li>
  <li><p style="margin:0;">Day 2: pick up snowshoes and rest of food from campground, and then hike to Inland Lake. </p></li>
  <li><p style="margin:0;">Day 3: hike to Fiddlehead Landing.</p></li>
  <li><p style="margin:0;">Day 4: hike to Tinhat Mountain.</p></li>
  <li><p style="margin:0;">Day 5: hike to Elk Lake</p></li>
  <li><p style="margin:0;">Day 6: hike to Walk Hill</p></li>
  <li><p style="margin:0;">Day 7: hike to Mount Troubridge</p></li>
  <li><p style="margin:0;">Day 8: complete the hike</p></li>
</ul>

We know that the first 80km or so are free of snow, due to the relatively low elevation, and so we plan to cover a lot of ground in the first two days: 33km on the first day, to Rieveley's Pond, and 32km on the second, to Inland Lake. 

On the way to the campground, we pick up coffee and pizza bread, loading up on as many calories as we can. It is still windy from last night's storm, but nowhere near as intense. After stashing our gear with a very nice lady at the campground, I call a cab so that we can get to Lund, which is a half-hour car ride north of Powel River. The operator on the phone informs me that <em>both</em> taxis are busy, but that she would send one soon as possible. While we wait for the cab, a lady approaches us. Her name is Jill, and from her outfit it's easy to tell she's also a hiker. She asks us if we're doing the Sunshine Coast Trail (our large backpacks probably gave us away). We say yes and tell her about our plan. And to our surprise, Jill offers us a ride from the trailhead back to the campground to grab our stuff the next day to save us some time and energy, and gives me her cell number. Alex and I are flabbergasted - everyone we've encounted at Powell River have been bewilderingly kind. 

During the cab ride, our driver tells us that some other hikers he's picked up recently told him that some parts of the trail were still covered in over 2 meters of snow. Good thing we packed our snowshoes!

It is recommended to hike the Sunshine Coast Trail from north to south. The trailhead is called Sarah Point, and it is generally accessed by taking a water taxi from Lund. We had booked the water taxi with two other hikers, but unfortunately, due to the previous night's storm, their ferry to the Sunshine Coast got cancelled, so we had to split the cost of the ride in half, costing each of us over $100.
