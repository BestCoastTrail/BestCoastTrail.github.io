The next morning is cold, only a couple of degrees above freezing. It is painful to get out of my incredibly warm sleeping quilt (thanks <a href="http://www.enlightenedequipment.com/">Enlightened Equipment!</a>) and change out of my sleeping clothes into my cold and still-damp clothes from yesterday. We make some tea, wolf down some scoops of peanut butter, and start on our way.

It doesn't take long for us to realize how sore we are from yesterday's hike. Eventually, it starts to warm up and we feel better.

We have quite the distance to cover today as well: 32km to our next hut at Inland Lake. We'll be passing through Powell River on our way to Inland, and so we are looking forward to having a nice meal and picking up the food and snowshoes we left at the campground. 

We run into a handful of people, all of whom are walking small sections of the trail. We haven't met any thru-hikers yet!

The nice thing about hiking this trail in April is that we don't have to worry about water at all. In the late summer months, I read that some parts of the section have hardly any water, and so it's necessary to carry many liters at a time - but for us, we didn't need to carry more than a liter. We brought with us Sawyer water filters, and they worked perfectly. Not having to fiddle with purification tablets or some finicky battery-operated UV light is a luxury. We just scoop some water in and suck!

I've used my filter in Peru and China without getting sick, so I was confident that the pristine Sunshine Coast creeks would be no problem.

The trail today is feels different from yesterday's. We're at higher elevation, so we get some nice views of the scenary around us. Again, the weather is perfect, sunnier than yesterday and much warmer too.

After 5 hours or so of hiking, we are getting near Powell River. I'm starving, thinking about the huge meal I'll be having soon. We go to the first restaurant we see: <a href="http://shinglemill.ca/">Shingle Mill</a>. The food is <em>excellent</em>. I eat a gigantic meal of
